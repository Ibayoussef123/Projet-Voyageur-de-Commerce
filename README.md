## Overview

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the origin city.

This project implements a solution to the TSP using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, an optimization technique inspired by the annealing process of slowly cooling a material to reduce its defects.

## Features

- Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing.
- Supports calculating distances using Haversine formula for real-world coordinates.
- Adjustable parameters like initial temperature and cooling rate for fine-tuning.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ibayoussef123/Projet-Voyageur-de-Commerce.git
    cd traveling-salesman
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your city data in a CSV file with the following format:**

    ```plaintext
